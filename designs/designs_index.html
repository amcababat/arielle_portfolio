                For two years, I have been volunteering at the Design Careers Club at UC Davis. This club is a non-profit organization where volunteers create and host career-related events for design students.The club is dedicated to providing career-building workshops year round as well as hosting Department Events like Internship Night and Alumni Networking Day. The biggest event the club contributes to the design community is the Design Career Fair, held annually each Spring. By organizing events like these, we can reach our main goal, which on a large scale is to create an environment that supports a diverse range of designers, from design emphases to individual identities. We hope that by creating this environment it will establish UC Davis Department of Design’s reputation in the progressive design community.

                <img src="DCF/DCF_pin_designs_draft_1.jpg" alt="draft 1" class="img-big"> One of my proudest projects from this experience was the button designs for the club. I made the initiative to design and create these buttons since my roommate has a button making kit. The first draft was when the team lead, co-directors, and I thought we were going to make these buttons as freebies for the fair. Therefore, I was told to create cute designs for the buttons. As someone who loves puns, I immediately thought about some design related puns for the attendees to enjoy as seen below. I used the club's official colors since the buttons will be featured on our table at the career fair.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the critique on the first draft, I was told to create cute icons, to choose a different design for the third piece, and to create 5 different designs for the fair. It sounded as if the puns were working, so I created a few more with one of the new designs featuring our clubs airplane icon.

                <img src="DCF/DCF_pin_designs_Final.jpg" alt="final design" class="img-big"> Eventually, I ended up having to use the official icons the club developed that represents several of the design emphases UC Davis Design department has such as fashion (the mannequin), graphic design (pen tool), and web design (the screens). I used the colors from the logo of this year's event and one of the colors from the club's official colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked my roommate if I could use her equipment and make the buttons in her stead since she had midterms coming up on that week. The biggest challenges when making them was to make sure the icons were lined up properly so that the icon would be straight when the user wears it.

                I interned at the California Center for Cooperative Development for a little over six months. They provide assistance to help and form coperatives. This organization educates the public and groups interested in forming a cooperative providing basic information about the business model involved, financing, management,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the projects I worked on include making a logo for Yolo Eco-clean and the California Grain Campaign, social media graphics for their annual event called the California Cooperative Conference, which I also made a logo of, and some posters for that event.

                This was assigned to the class where we learned how to use javascript. Above in quotations is a short description of the project. I decided that since I was such a bookworm, I would do something akin to the What's in My Bag task, but I would portray what kinds of things are in my book shelf. The user would hover over the groups of books and the paragraph under the title in bold would use innerHTML to tell the user what those groups of books tell about me.

                I made a list of what kinds of books my current life is centered on, which were sketchbooks, desgin books, and animation books. Then I made the bookshelf and books in Illustrator. I converted them to grayscale in Photoshop. After the illustrations were done, I started writing the code for the interface. After I was done writing the html, I used the position attribute in css to place the bookshelf and books onto the webpage. Then I used position: fixed to make sure the section on the right stays in its proper position even when scrolling down.

                I took a package design class and we were to create a brand for a food industry of our choosing. I decided to create a coconut milk ice cream brand that would have flavors reminiscent of flavors one would have on Hawai'i. The first challenge of designing thise logo was picking a name for the brand. The name changed from CoCo Cream to Aina Ice Cream to Palm Cream. I finally chose the name Tropiscoop. I chose a tropical color scheme for this logo, and I decided to go crazy for it since the logo featured five colors. For the logotype, I decided to use the shape of a soft serve ice cream for its iconic and distinct shape. The cross-hatching on the logotype's cone is supposed to be reminiscent of a cone and pineapple.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the brand we made, we were to design a graphic standard for it. I especially paid extra attention of how not to use my logo. I included some marketing strategies and what the colors of the flavors would be. You can view my graphic standard <a href="https://issuu.com/ariellecababat/docs/tropiscoop_graphic_standard_final" class="aside_link">here.</a>
