                I took a class that teaches you how to use Maya. This was for the final project. I decided to model an interior since I was familiar in making floor plans. I used to do them for fun when I was thirteen. I chose an interior I got off the internet (first image shown). From looking at that image, I drew the floor plan for it. Since the image only showed the living room, and I wanted to create a studio apartment, I decided to add other stuff to the layout such as the kitchen and bathroom and a bed.

            <p>
                The final outlook are the last three images.I was not able to model the entire bathroom (And I thought having a bathroom right next to a kitchen would be unsanitary). So I just put the bedroom between the kitchen and bathroom. I rendered three different perspectives of the living room since I thought that was the most interesting part of the model.

                After the 3D modeling class that teaches how to use Maya, I took the class that comes after that. That was a character animation class. For this project, we were required to make something that played to the music. I was inspired by the 2D animated movie <em>Anastasia</em>. So I modeled some elements from that movie such as the music box and the dancing couple. I used Quicktime to trim the audio to only a couple of seconds. Then I modeled the couple myself to make it seem as if they are touching each other. Since character rigging is an entire class altogether, the class mostly focuses on placing the keyframes. Therefore, instead of create a rig for my characters, I grouped them and manipulated where they would dance and how much they would turn. You can view the video from that animation below.
