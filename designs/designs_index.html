                For two years, I have been volunteering at the Design Careers Club at UC Davis. This club is a non-profit organization where volunteers create and host career-related events for design students.The club is dedicated to providing career-building workshops year round as well as hosting Department Events like Internship Night and Alumni Networking Day. The biggest event the club contributes to the design community is the <a href="http://www.ucddesigncareerfair.com/" class="aside_link link_line">Design Career Fair</a>, held annually each Spring. By organizing events like these, we can reach our main goal, which on a large scale is to create an environment that supports a diverse range of designers, from design emphases to individual identities. We hope that by creating this environment it will establish UC Davis Department of Design’s reputation in the progressive design community.

                <img src="DCF/DCF_pin_designs_draft_1.jpg" alt="draft 1" class="img-big"> One of my proudest projects from this experience was the button designs for the club. I made the initiative to design and create these buttons since my roommate has a button making kit. The first draft was when the team lead, co-directors, and I thought we were going to make these buttons as freebies for the fair. Therefore, I was told to create cute designs for the buttons. As someone who loves puns, I immediately thought about some design related puns for the attendees to enjoy as seen below. I used the club's official colors since the buttons will be featured on our table at the career fair.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the critique on the first draft, I was told to create cute icons, to choose a different design for the third piece, and to create 5 different designs for the fair. It sounded as if the puns were working, so I created a few more with one of the new designs featuring our clubs airplane icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="DCF/DCF_pin_designs_Final.jpg" alt="final design" class="img-big"> Eventually, I ended up having to use the official icons the club developed that represents several of the design emphases UC Davis Design department has such as fashion (the mannequin), graphic design (pen tool), and web design (the screens). I used the colors from the logo of this year's event and one of the colors from the club's official colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked my roommate if I could use her equipment and make the buttons in her stead since she had midterms coming up on that week. The biggest challenges when making them was to make sure the icons were lined up properly so that the icon would be straight when the user wears it.

                I interned at the California Center for Cooperative Development for a little over six months. They provide assistance to help and form coperatives. This organization educates the public and groups interested in forming a cooperative providing basic information about the business model involved, financing, management,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the projects I worked on include making a logo for Yolo Eco-clean and the California Grain Campaign, social media graphics for their annual event called the California Cooperative Conference, which I also made a logo of, and some posters for that event. Shown above are some of the projects that I was the proudest to make.

                This was assigned to the class where we learned how to use javascript. Above in quotations is a short description of the project. I decided that since I was such a bookworm, I would do something akin to the What's in My Bag task, but I would portray what kinds of things are in my book shelf. The user would hover over the groups of books and the paragraph under the title in bold would use innerHTML to tell the user what those groups of books tell about me.

                I made a list of what kinds of books my current life is centered on, which were sketchbooks, desgin books, and animation books. Then I made the bookshelf and books in Illustrator. I converted them to grayscale in Photoshop. After the illustrations were done, I started writing the code for the interface. After I was done writing the html, I used the position attribute in css to place the bookshelf and books onto the webpage. Then I used position: fixed to make sure the section on the right stays in its proper position even when scrolling down.

            <h2>Tropiscoop</h2>
            <h3>My brand in a package design class</h3>
        </button>
        <aside id="paragraph_2">

            <h2>Tropiscoop</h2>
            <ul class="img-list">

            <p>
                I took a package design class and we were to create a brand for a food industry of our choosing. I decided to choose an ice cream brand that would have flavors reminiscent of flavors one would have on Hawai'i. Based on the brand we made, we were to design a graphic standard for it. I especially paid extra attention of how not to use my logo. I included some marketing strategies and what the colors of the flavors would be. On this website, you can read a short version of the process. However, if you like, then you can click <a href="https://issuu.com/ariellecababat/docs/des_116_process_manual" class="aside_link link_line">here</a> to read the full process on issuu.
            </p>
            <h2>Logo Development</h2>
            <p>
                I started this process with sketches where the direction of the logo was to envoke a feeling of fun while also maintaining a clean outlook.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/tropiscoop_logo_protos.png" alt="Logo Proto" class="img-aside float-left dis_img">Then multiple digital renderings were done in Adobe Illustrator for this logo. One of the challenges of this part of the process was coming up with the name of the brand, making sure it did not hold any similarities with existing ice cream brands while being able to be easily remembered. Another challenge was to choose a suitable typeface for the logo. Eventually, I decided to call the brand Tropiscoop, using the display typeface Foo for its rounded terminals and thick strokes.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphic Standard</h2>
            <p>
                After creating the logo, I was required to make a graphic standard for the brand. In it, I made specifications for the business system, marketing strategies, and logo specifications for what is and what is not proper usage of the logo. I paid particular attention to the improper logo usage since one can do a lot of fun things with the logo I made. You can view my graphic standard <a href="https://issuu.com/ariellecababat/docs/tropiscoop_graphic_standard_final" class="aside_link link_line">here</a> if you would like to read the whole graphic standard
            </p>
            <h2>Competition Research</h2>
            <p>
                This part of the project started with a competition research where I frequently visited the grocery store to examine the package design of ice cream brands. From what was seen in the grocery store, most ice cream packaging uses paperboard for their tubs. Some brands such as Baskin’ Robin’s use a plastic lid with a certain tab that will keep the lid from opening. Other brands such as Melona and Drumsticks use boxes and individually packs each portion. Other brands are using color schemes or see through containers for their package design.
            </p>
            <h2>Audience Survey</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="images/google_form_questions.png" alt="google form questions" class="img-aside float-left dis_img">Since my intended audience is college students, I decided to do an audience survey. I made a google form and asked my fellow college students to answer it. I gathered the responses and considered what kind of packaging can I design based on their responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/google_form.png" alt="google form" class="img-aside float-right dis_img"> Some of the responses indicated that most college students prefer to buy pint-size ice cream tubs. This made sense since college students are generally low-income and pint-size tubs are cheaper. Other responses included whether to save ice cream for later or what stands out about the packaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of design, I asked what problems do college students have with the design of ice cream packaging. Some of the responses stated that there was no convenient place to put the lid when opening the tub, especially if the college student lives with several other people.
            </p>
            <h2>Final Packaging</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="images/final_package.jpg" alt="final package" class="img-aside float-left dis_img"> The final package design takes into consideration the responses of the targeted audience based on the responses to the audience survey. In order to keep a fresh look for the packaging, the pattern on the base pay homage to its Hawaii life background by having a pattern based on Aloha shirts. The flavor, nutrition facts, barcode, logotype, ingredients and allergens are printed along the tub. The lid and tub are attached to each other so that college students will not have to worry about the inconvenience of the lid. Its octagonal shape will make maximum use of space when transferring the product to the grocery store.
