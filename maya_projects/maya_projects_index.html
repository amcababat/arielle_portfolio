            <h2>3D Modeled Studio Apartment</h2>
            <p>
                I took a class that teaches you how to use Maya. This was for the final project. I decided to model an interior since I was familiar in making floor plans. I used to do them for fun when I was thirteen. I chose an interior I got off the internet (first image shown). From looking at that image, I drew the floor plan for it. Since the image only showed the living room, and I wanted to create a studio apartment, I decided to add other stuff to the layout such as the kitchen and bathroom and a bed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final outlook are the last three images.I was not able to model the entire bathroom (And I thought having a bathroom right next to a kitchen would be unsanitary). So I just put the bedroom between the kitchen and bathroom. I rendered three different perspectives of the living room since I thought that was the most interesting part of the model.
