        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
            Despite what this website is called, my name is Arielle Cababat. I was born and raised on the isolated state of Hawaii. I came to the mainland to study English at the University of California, Davis. However, I realized I hated that subject, so I decided to switch to film studies, but I hated that too. So I switched to film production and hated that too. Eventually, I found design and met people in a career club. After taking more design classes, I decided to major in that since it has led me to meet more people and create graphics for their businesses.

            I gained an interest in animation recently and decided to learning about that on the side too. Therefore, I am planning to save up for animation school in the future. For now, I am going to learn the software from online sources. Anyway, feel free to explore and enjoy!
