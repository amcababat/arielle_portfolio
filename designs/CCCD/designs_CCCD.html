            I interned at the California Center for Cooperative Development for a little over six months. They provide assistance to help coperatives. This organization educates the public and groups interested in forming a cooperative providing basic information about the business model involved, financing, management,etc.

            Some of the projects I worked on include making a logo for Yolo Eco-clean and the California Grain Campaign, social media graphics for their annual event called the California Cooperative Conference, which I also made a logo of, and some posters for that event. You'll see some the work below this paragraph
